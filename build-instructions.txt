Build Instructions for linux

== Get Titanium Desktop ==

# Remove the current titanium
sudo rm -rf ~/.titanium

# Download a fresh copy
cd ~/
wget http://www.appcelerator.com/download-linux32

# Extract and move it to ~/.titanium
  tar xzf download-linux32
  sudo mv Titanium\ Developer-* ~/.titanium

# For some reason this can't be ran under a shell script
# Run the folling command manuall
  ~/.titanium/Titanium\ Developer

# (install to my home directory)

# The above will give you an error, when you complete the installation
# now do the following

# from titanium forums
  sudo rm ~/.titanium/runtime/linux/1.0.0/libg2*
  sudo rm ~/.titanium/runtime/linux/1.0.0/libgio*
  sudo rm ~/.titanium/runtime/linux/1.0.0/libglib*
  sudo rm ~/.titanium/runtime/linux/1.0.0/libgobject*
  sudo rm ~/.titanium/runtime/linux/1.0.0/libgthread*

# Applications look directly under ~/.titanium for their stuff
# when building it looks under the platform directory. So keep both.
  cp -R ~/.titanium/runtime/linux/1.0.0/* ~/.titanium/runtime/

== Run The Build Sript ==
sudo sh build.sh

This will create a build in ./builds/linux/vegas/..

From there you can run the application with ./vegas
